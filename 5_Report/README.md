# INTRODUCTION
1.Over the past two decades, the automotive industry has aggressively researched ways toexploit modern computing and electronic advances in the development of safety, reliability,an entertainment technology for vehicles. Previously remarkable and uncommon features suchas auto dimming mirrors and rear-view cameras have become standard in the modern era.Today consumers expect their automobiles to be able to connect to their MP3 players, provideGPS-assisted visual directions, and allow hands-free phone calls via Bluetooth technology.While these features have improved the driving experience for many, they also imply theincreasingly common interaction between driver and electronic gadgetry during vehicleoperation. These interactions can be a dangerous distraction for the driver, who must takehis/her eyes off the road to attend to a device.
2.The working of the wiper is based on conversion of the wiper motorslinear motion into linear back forth motion. Inside the motor/gear assembly is the electroniccircuit senses when the wiper are in their down position. One system designed for vision aidin windshield assembly. A circuit for a windshield wiper motor is developed in which wipermotor is made automatically responsive to the presence water droplets on the windshieldcausing the wiper blades sweep back and forth at a rate dependent upon the level ofprecipitation encountered. In this project, design and working Windshield wiper speed controlwill be discussed taking into account the recent challenges in the windshield assembly
3.Existing system manually used control stalk to activate wiper and the process of pulling upwiper is difficult to be handled. The driver needs to switch on and off the control stalk and itwill reduce the driver’s concentration during the driving.This is an era of automation where itis broadly defined as replacement of manual effort by mechanical power in all degrees ofautomation. Now a day’s almost all the automobile vehicles are being atomized in order toreduce human efforts. Thus, this system is proposed to solve all these problems.   

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
                                                           
1.Manual Handling:
   The manual handling of the current wiper systems cause trouble to the driver while drivingin tough situations like heavy rainfall or during foggy conditions.
2.Switching of Wiper:
    The switching of wiper can cause distraction while driving which can lead to accidents onhighways or sharp turns if precautions are not taken. 
3.Speed Control:
   During rainfall with changing intensity or stormy conditions, there is need to change thespeed of wiper according to the requirement.
 
# OBJECTIVES
     
      This project aims to develop an Automated Rain Operated System taking the followingobjectives:
1.To operate the wiper with response to changing rainfall or driving conditions, thus
2.keeping the driver’s windshield clear.
3.To implement a control system this reduces human efforts.
4.To increase automation in vehicle driving system.
5.To achieve high safety by reducing the driver’s work load.
6.To minimize rates of accident caused by distraction in driving.
7.To make the system easy to install.
To develop a cheaper automated system that can be integrated easily.

# METHADOLOGY
1.For controlling the speed of motor the electronic circuit is provided with threeterminals ( Low speed, High speed and Common ). Both the terminals are connectedto the Switching circuit at their respective positions.
2.Beaker is provided to act as a water level sensor where the rain water gets collected.
3.Motor having positive and negative terminals. The positive terminal of the motor isconnected to the Switching circuit and the negative terminal of the motor is connectedto the negative terminal of the battery.
4.Now the Low speed terminal of switching circuit is connected at the intermediate levelof the beaker and High speed terminal is connected to the top most level of the beaker.
5.The switching circuit is provided with 9V supply and positive terminal of switchingcircuit is placed at lowest level of Beaker.
 
# WORKING
1.The circuit is provided with a 3-way switch. When the switch is moved upwards thewiper motor starts manually at constant speed. At middle position, the system isswitched OFF. When the switch is moved downwards the automatic mode wipersystem gets ON.
2.When the rain water gets collected in the beaker, until the level of water reaches thelevel of Low speed terminal; the wiper will remain stopped.
3.As soon as the water level reaches the Low speed terminal level, the circuit getscompleted and the Wiper motor is actuated at Low speed.
4.If the water level is further rised to the High speed level, the High speed circuit getscompleted and the Wiper motor will actuate at High speed.
5.In order to avoid overflow of water and to avoid continuous working of wiper motor,holes are provided on the side of beaker at certain level below Low speed level andHigh speed level terminals.
6.Due to the holes when the water reaches level below the High speed level, the wipermotor again runs at Low speed.
7.Further fall in water level below the Low speed level, the wiper motor ultimately stopsrunning          
 
# RESULTS
 The results are obtained based on the type of beaker andarrangement of the terminals on the beaker and may vary according to change in type ofbeaker and arrangement of terminals.Thus, the wiper system can be used at manual and automatic mode. 
 On automatic mode, thewiper works at low speed when the water level reaches the level of Low speed terminal. Thehigh speed of wiper is achieved when the water level reaches the High speed terminal. 
 Whenthe water is below both the terminals, wiper motor will stop working.The terminal height can be adjusted according to the requirement. Sensitivity to the rain canbe achieved by increasing and decreasing the distances between the terminals.

 # CONCLUSION
 An automated rain operated wiper system is designed, developed, and demonstrated to detectrain and actuate the windshield wiper based on the intensity of rain with the use of the waterlevel type sensor which is one of the conductive method.
 This wiper system will reduce the cumbersome wiper operation and improve driver’s level
comfort. It will give a new dimension of comfort and aid to the drivers who work at night andtraffic prone areas where they already have to concentrate on brakes and clutches. Theremoval of controlling the wipers during rain will provide them ease and help them toconcentrate on the basic ABC (accelerator, brake and clutch) of driving.

# FUTURE SCOPE
The circuit developed in this paper is based on conductive type sensing element that is using awater level sensor and then according to the level of water in the beaker the wiper motor getsactuated.There can be further modification in future by replacing the water level sensor with aconductive type patterned sensor which can directly provide the output resistance according tochange in water intensity.The circuit can also be modified by using other types of sensors like capacitive, piezoelectricor ultrasonic but the output of the circuit will vary accordingly with the use of sensor.
